# Smoothier

PhpStorm 7 theme based off of [Smoothie].

### About

I rather like the general color scheme of Smoothie, but it is an older
theme and has not been updated to support the new color options added
since its creation.

I tried to remain as true to the original as possible, but I have made
minor changes.

### Usage

Close PhpStorm if it's open. Download `Smoothie.icls` and place it in
your PhpStorm's color scheme directory. Start PhpStorm and select the
color theme.
